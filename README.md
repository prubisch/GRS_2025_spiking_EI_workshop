# GRS workshop: Modelling spiking neural networks
This repository provides all code and pre-trained BRIAN networks for the workshop "Modelling the effect of inhibition on synchronicity and regularity in spiking network" and "De-correlating activity via inhibitory plasticity during memory recall". The second Jupyter notebook *Background knowledge about simulation-based network neuroscience* is a complementary notebook explaining the Euler Method and giving a bit of background knowledge about the problem of complexity in network models. 

In order to run all cells in *Spiking EI Networks - GRS Tutorial*, you need to first extract *stored_networks.zip*. This will enable you to load the pretrained networks. 
If you want to train the networks yourself, uncomment all cells as indicated in the notebook. Runtime might be up to 30 minutes.
